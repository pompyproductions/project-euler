# Project Euler exercises

Repository where I solve and (hopefully) prepare visualisations for the exercises in Project Euler.  
Once I get this going, I'll post the Live Preview link here too.

Here's the link to the original website where the problems are posted:
https://projecteuler.net/

Also, here's a quote from that page which I will particularly abide by:  
> "The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and **learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.**"

## Approach

I will first solve these questions through JavaScript alone, probably some of them less elegantly than others.  
My main goal is not to achieve the fastest execution time possible, but to make them with visualisation and eventual spin-offs in mind.

As an example, I might add HTML inputs that _default to the original question_ yet which can be modified.

I'll be updating my approach and goals as I solve along.
